This is a collaboration with a pioneer band named, Earspeak to visualize a piece of their music - Stumble.

During the pandemic, many artists’ gigs were suddenly canceled or postponed until further notice. Many, including artists were affected by the situation and lost their main source of income.

A musical project conceived many years ago between John Hadfield (music, percussion, and synths) and Boris Skalsky (music, vocals, and keys) has a chance to be polished and released. Stumble is one of the songs created by Earspeak.

My role for Stumble is translating the acoustic feelings and emotions carried within the music to visual. With discussion of something simple to enhance the release experience. I made a hand drawn music video for Stumble and it was completed in time to promote Earspeak’s song releasing on major streaming platforms.
